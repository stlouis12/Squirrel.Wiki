      ## Pages and Content

      ### How do I edit a page?

      Navigate to any page and click the **Edit** button. Make your changes and click **Save**. All changes are tracked in the version history.

      ### Can I see who edited a page?

      Yes! Each page has a version history that shows all edits, who made them, and when. Click the **History** button on any page to view it.

      ### What happens if I make a mistake?

      Don't worry! Every version of a page is saved. You can view the history and restore any previous version if needed.

      ### How do I delete a page?

      ## Organization

      ### What's the difference between categories and tags?

      - **Categories**: Hierarchical organization structure. Each page can belong to one category.
      - **Tags**: Flexible keywords for cross-referencing. Pages can have multiple tags.

      Use categories for main organization and tags for additional classification.

      ### How do I create a new category?

      Administrators can create categories through the **Admin** → **Categories** menu. Categories help organize related pages together.

      ### Can I have nested categories?

      Yes! Squirrel Wiki supports hierarchical categories. You can create parent and child categories to organize content in a tree structure.

      There's no hard limit, but we recommend 3-7 relevant tags per page for best organization and searchability.

      ## Search

      ### How does search work?

      Squirrel Wiki uses Lucene.NET for full-text search. It indexes:
      - Page titles

      - Tags
      - Categories

      The search is fast and supports advanced queries.

      ### Can I search within a specific category?

      Yes! Use the category browser to view all pages in a category, or use the search with category filters.

      ### Why isn't my new page showing up in search?

      The search index updates automatically, but there may be a brief delay. Try refreshing the page or waiting a few seconds.

      ## Permissions and Users

      ### What are the different user roles?

      - **Viewer**: Can read pages only
      - **Editor**: Can create and edit pages
      - **Admin**: Full access including user management, settings, and deletions

      ### How do I change my password?

      Click on your username in the top-right corner and select **Profile**. You can update your password there.

      ### Can I control who sees specific pages?

      Currently, all pages are visible to all users. Role-based page permissions may be added in future versions.

      ### How do I add new users?

      Administrators can add users through the **Admin** → **Users** menu. You can set their role and permissions there.

      ## Customization

      ## Troubleshooting

      ### I forgot my admin password. What do I do?

      Contact your system administrator. They can reset passwords through the admin panel or directly in the database.

      ### Pages aren't saving. What's wrong?

      Check that:
      1. You're logged in as an Editor or Admin
      2. The page isn't locked
      3. Your session hasn't expired
      4. The database is writable

      ### Search isn't working. How do I fix it?

      Try:
      1. Rebuilding the search index (Admin → System Info)
      2. Checking that the Lucene index directory is writable
      3. Reviewing the application logs for errors

      ### The wiki is running slowly. How can I improve performance?

      - Enable caching in settings
      - Use a production database (PostgreSQL/MySQL instead of SQLite)
      - Ensure adequate server resources
      - Consider using Redis for distributed caching
